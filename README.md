This music app consist of two models: User and Song. Within the User model I've included an id, username and password field. The Song model includes an id, title and length field. The User model references the Song.

# Which DB do you prefer, SQL or NoSQL?
I perfer NoSQL over SQL because it's easier to "join" tables together, whether that be by embedding or referencing.

# What went right? Challenges you faced? Which part you enjoyed working on the most?
I came across a few errors when I tried to include queries. Beside that bump in the road everything else was pretty smooth. I enjoyed creating the services/controllers as well as be able to create users and songs.
